          <p id="secondary">Meet the Hydration Cowboy, a former Louisiana frog
            named Ethan "Ez" Springs, transformed by a water spirit into a man
            with a mission to hydrate the parched corners of the world. Leaping
            across the plains with his canteen-holsters, he's an unlikely hero,
            educating everyone he meets on the importance of hydration. Over
            time,
            this amphibious cowboy's tireless efforts have turned him into a
            legend, symbolizing his belief: "Hydration is a right, not a fight!"</p>

          <h5>Ethan harbors an adoration for his loyal hen, Clara, that once saw
            him overhydrate her in a fit of overzealous care, a slip-up that
            provoked Clara's feathery fury and left him on the receiving end of
            an irate clucking lecture.</h5>

          <h5>Once, at a local birthday party, Ethan rode around on a faux pony,
            preaching his "hydrate or diedrate" mantra to a horde of
            sugar-fueled kids, an endeavor that culminated in a chaotic
            water-balloon uprising.</h5>

          <h5>On his transformation day, Ethan discovered he wasn't alone; his
            cousin had also experienced the same metamorphosis, and they
            commemorated their shared destiny with a jubilant photo, forever
            capturing their bond as the hydration cowboys.</h5>

            Hydro Frog, eager to boost bottle sales, approached Ethan for a
            collaboration, leading to an iconic photo shoot featuring the
            amphibious cowboy straddling a gargantuan hydration bottle.</h5>
